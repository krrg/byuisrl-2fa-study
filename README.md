# BYU ISRL 2FA Study

This website was built as part of a series of usability studies on two-factor authentication for the Internet Security Research Lab at BYU.

The backend authentication server is written with [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and the [Vert.x](http://vertx.io) web framework.

The frontend uses React.js, Yarn, SCSS, Webpack, Babel, and probably many other interesting things.
